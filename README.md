# Advanced AI & Machine Learning in Python

This repository contains several stand-alone projects that simulate complex real-world problems and solves them using advanced AI & Machine learning
algorithms. Each sub-directory contains a detailed pdf description of the problem. 

## Amazon Drones

Places Amazon drones to maximize serving capacity in a grid system. Implemented through Astar and DFS algorithms.

## Submarines

Given information about the terrain, this program creates a set of policies (instructions) for how to best navigate the 
surroundings. Implemented through policy value iteration algorithm.

## Masterchef

Given information about each Masterchef contestant, this program simulates the role of Team Captain A to select the best possible
team (given that there is an alternative picking scheme with Team Captain B). Implemented through Minimax algorithm. 

## Naive Bayes Classifier

Given a large data set of emails classified as Spam and Normal, this program analyzes the content of the emails to be able 
to automatically and correctly identify future Spam emails with 95% accuracy.
